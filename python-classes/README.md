# Object-oriented programming in python

Python is an object-oriented programming language, and it supports all the fundamental OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm for organizing code into objects, which are instances of classes, and allows you to model real-world entities and their interactions by using classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects.

### Key concepts of object-oriented programming

## Class:
An object of a certain class will contain certain properties (data) and methods (functions), which are defined by the class as a blueprint or template. It contains the information and functionality of the objects it generates. The class keyword is used to declare a class in Python.

## Object:
A class's constructor is used to generate an object, which is an instance of the class. Each object has a unique set of properties and is able to use the methods that are specified for that class.

## Encapsulation:
The concept of encapsulation limits access to specific class characteristics or methods. This can be done in Python by using getter/setter functions and private attributes (prefixed with two underscores __).

## Inheritance:
A class (subclass) may inherit properties and functions from a superclass (the parent class) through the process of inheritance. It makes it easier to have hierarchical relationships between classes and reuse code.

## Polymorphism:
Through the use of polymorphism, objects from several classes can be handled as though they belong to the same superclass. Through a standard interface, it enables code to interact with various kinds of objects.

## Usage
Each directory in this repository corresponds to a distinct project or illustration. One Python script, several related scripts, or both can be found in each directory. Navigate to a specific Python script's directory to run it, then use the Python interpreter to run the script.
