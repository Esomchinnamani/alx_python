# Python Functions

This Repository cotains a collection of python funtion codes.

## Definition

A function, in python, is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

A function may be invoked from any other function by passing required data (called parameters or arguments). The called function returns its result back to the calling environment.

## Types of Python Functions
Python provides the following types of functions âˆ’

i. Built-in functions
ii. Functions defined in built-in modules
iii. User-defined functions


Components of a Python Function

-parameters: These are optional input values that the function can accept. Parameters are enclosed within parentheses and can be used inside the function.

-Function body: This is the indented block of code that contains the instructions and logic for the function.

-return: This keyword is used to specify the value that the function will return after its execution. If the function does not return anything, you can omit the return statement.

-def: This keyword is used to define a function in Python.

-function_name: This is the name of the function. Choose a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the function. It should follow Python's naming conventions.
